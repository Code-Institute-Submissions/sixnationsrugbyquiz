# Six Nations Rugby Quiz

For my **Portfolio 3 Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created a command line Six Nations Rugby Quiz game.  Just like the tournament itself there are six sections for each of the countries.  The user will be asked 5 random questions in each section relating to a particular country.  The user can select whichever country their want to start with and work their way through each country, when their score will be totalled and they will find out if they made the leaderboard or not!   

Link to the deployed app is [here](https://sixnationsrugbyquiz.herokuapp.com/).

As a user it is important: 

1. That it is easy to follow the game. 
2. To understand the rules of the game.

6. To answer questions and receive a result. 
7. To view their scores. 
8. To view the leaderboard.  


### Users Fulfilment

1.  The game is laid out clearly so the user knows immediately what to do.  A welcome message is provided prompting the user for their name. 
2.  Rules are available for the user to view. 
3.  Clear instructions are given on how to start the game.
4.  Clear instructions are given on how to select the country they want to play.

## Testing


### Local Testing


### User Testing

The website was sent to a group of approximately 15 people of all different ages.  My children 6 and 8 also tested the game and could manage functionality well and really enjoyed it.  Other users found the game easy to work through but found it hard to win in under 8 flips.  I didn't change the flip lives because of this as all users kept going back to the game to try to win!  Some in competition with others.  I liked this as they kept coming back to it.  Devices used to test were as follows: 


### Browser Testing

The Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Opera.   On all browsers testing was as expected.  Functionality and responsiveness are good. 


### Validators 

The website was tested using Jigsaw W3C validation. 




### Responsiveness 

To check responsiveness I used Google Chrome Dev Tools.  Desktop, Mobile and tablet sizes were tested.  The website responded well.   
<br>

###  Result: Chrome Lighthouse

## Version Control


### Git and GitHub 

Local repository and IDE used: GitPod
Remote repository used: GitHub

Steps followed: 
- I created a new public repository on GitHub using the Code Institute template.
- I then created a workspace and started coding on GitPod. 
- All relevant files were created. 
- As I worked I previewed changes using python??.
- To save my work safely I continued to use the terminal consistently by using: 
    - **git add .** to add work to git
    - **git commit -m""** to commit the work 
    - **git push** to update work to GitHub 


### Deployment
